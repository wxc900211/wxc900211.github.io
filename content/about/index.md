## My Interesting Background

### Education
* I graduated from China Agriculture University in 2012 and my bachelor major is Electrical Engineering.
* Then I went to National Chengchi University for pursuing my mater degree in 2014. At that time, I started to try combining business and techonology through my major -- Manegement of Information Systems.
*  Currently I am studying Business Analytics at BI Oslo and will graduate in June 2024.

From **Beijing**, to **Taipei**,and then to **Oslo**, different cities and different majories inspire me to **think creatively** and **do practically**.

### Work
* When I graduated from my bachelor university, I did not figure out my future career immediately. So I decided to enter into the society at first. I worked as a project assistant for 10 months. In the period, I understood my thought and decided to swicth to a new master major. 
* I worked for Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for 6 years. Besides normal projects, I accepted various chanlleges, such as designing the service mode of smart bank roborts and mapping out strategies to increase user experience, but received  a lot in different roles as well. 

My work vision is "Find the **most suitable**, but **not most advanced** solutions for the product. 
Create **more value** for the product!  "

## Why I came to Norway
* I would like to answer it as **"by chance"**. After 6 years' work, I felt bored and wanted to chanllge myself again.Although this is not an easy decision, the life is short. I am looking forward to seeing what will happen!
* Norway is far away from China and lifestyle here is quite different. I want to discover this **mysterious** land. This is the option I chose for chanlleging myself.
* After more than one year, I am getting used to Norwegian lifestyle (except the food part) and going to stay here longer.

## What you can find here
* This is a place for **displaying**, **sharing**, and **communicating**.
